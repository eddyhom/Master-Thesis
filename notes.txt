FER DATABASES:
*JAFFE dataset  [34].  https://zenodo.org/record/3451524?fbclid=IwAR2ArkPVYqGP4MVCFjmgkm5B9yJAff2taBBArj5PcJq14hIxk0J_W1DWec4#.Xo3Q3_GxVbq
*Fer2013  dataset  [35].  
*Cohn-Kanade  dataset and CK + dataset [36-37].
*RAF2017 dataset [38]
*And other data sets [39-41].

DATE PREPROCESSING:
Adaboost   algorithm   [42]   can remove   most   facial   features   such   as   hair,   neck,   and background   after   processing   facial   images,   and   reduce some  interference  information.

FACIAL EXPRESSION FEATURE EXTRACTION:
Based on overall image: PCA,LDA,DCNN.
Based on the face area: 
  Based on texture features: Gabor,  LBP.
  Based on geometric features: ASM, AAM.
  Model-based: Elastic matching, Optical flow method.

FRAMEWORK DESIGN OF CNNs: 
Image input, Convolutional layer, ReLU layer, Pooling layers, Fully connected layer, Classification layers.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS:
Used Python2.7, TensorFlow, Opencv-python(2.4.13), Openjdk-1.8.

Use  OpenCV  library  to  perform  face  detection.

Mouth is Open_half, The shape of mouth is Curve, The region of cheeks is Wrinkle, The degree of frown is No = Positive..
Mouth is Close, The shape of mouth is Straight, The region of cheeks is Flat, The degree of frown is Yes = Negative.
Mouth is Close, The shape of mouth is Straight, The region of cheeks is Flat, The degree of frown is No = Normal.

Human observe robots’ actions and give their facial expression as emotion rewards to induct robots’ learning.
